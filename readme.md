## About

Advent of Code is a series of challenges for the Christmas season that require writing simple algorithms to solve.

Take for Example:

[Task 5](2021/05/tasks.mjs) - Algorithm for mapping lines onto a 2D grid.

[Task 6](2021/06/tasks.mjs) - Algorithm for tracking Lanternfish Populations over time.

[Task 9](2021/09/tasks.mjs) - Flood-fill algorithm for identifying large basins in the sea floor.

[Task 12](2021/12/tasks.mjs) - Algorithm for finding all the possible paths through a omni-directional graph.

[Task 15](2021/15/protitytasks.mjs) - Pathfinding algorithm using a priority queue.
